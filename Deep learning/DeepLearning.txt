supervised
classification : yes/no like binary classification
regression
unsupervised try by itself
clustering and association

Reinforcement - 

simple linear regression
independent and dependent variable 

multiple linear regression 


-----------------------------------------------------------------
backpropagation -  learning from mistakes and correcting them 
ALGORITHMS-> AI -> ML ->DL 


DEEP LEARNING
SUBSET OF ML IN WHICH ANN ADAPT AND LEARN FROM CAST AMOUNTS OF DATA

neural network -series of algos that endeabors recognizes 
1. neurons
2. layers
3 .weights - how much the input is important
 and biases - starting tendency/flexibility
4. activation functions

inputs -  > weights  - >  bias - > activation fxn =>  output



---------------
feedforward / FNN -- basic classification and regression 
convolutional / CNN
RNNs
LSTM


weight is importance ,bias shift the output

its like throwing a ball on the target
too far 
to short 
learns after some predictions


Deep Learning

tensor flow
keras 
pytorch
