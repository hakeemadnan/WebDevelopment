    <!-- object literal used to store keyed(key value) collections and complex entities
    property => (key,value) pair
    objects are a collection of properties
    like student has name ,age ,marks are keys and their values is values and whole name is a property 
    ------------
    js automatically converts object keys to strings 
    even if we made the number as a key the numner will be converted to string
